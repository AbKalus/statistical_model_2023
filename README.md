# Statistical Model Course
### University of Trieste

## Learning Objectives

The objectives of the course are:

- Acquire the concepts, inferential techniques, and diagnostic tools for constructing linear models.
- Understand which phenomena are suitable for regression modeling and be able to specify, adapt, and interpret the results of a linear regression model.
- Gain some basic knowledge for the subsequent understanding of extensions and generalizations of the linear model.

## Practical Part

The course includes a practical part that involves the use of the software R for data analysis and the application of theoretical concepts.

## Prerequisites

Prerequisites include courses in Statistical Inference and Mathematics II.
